## Overview:
The Burger Simulator is a simple dashboard that allows the user to eat burgers in an organized manner! The Burgers that are added via text box are saved in a remote database as either devoured or not devoured.  This was primarily accomplished using Javascript, Handlebars, and MySQL.

### How it works!
To use the app enter a burger name into the text box.  After you have entered your desired burger click the Add Burger button.  You will see the burger is now displayed on the left side of the screen in the Burgers 2 Devour Category.  Click the Devour button next to it and the burger will then disappear and reappear on the right side of the screen in the Devoured Burgers Category!
